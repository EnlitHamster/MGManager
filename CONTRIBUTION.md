## How to contribute

Through the `Issues` page here on GitHub you can see what is actually needed in the plugin. Create your own branch of the repo or your own repo and work on the issue. Please, inform us in the section that you are indeed working on it so we can focus our efforts efficiently. Once you are done, open a pull request linked to the Issue you are working on.

Please, create/update JavaDoc for everything you do while working on an issue and pull requrest only when documentation is complete. Incomplete documentation will not be accepted.

If you find any bug, problem please open an issue specifying the following information:
- What happened: 
- When did it happen:
- What particular steps caused the issue:
- What else was happening on the server:
- Log of the console:
If need be, attach images of the issue.

If you have any feature you would like to see implemented, open an issue as well describing in detail what the idea is. If you want to work on it yourself, follow the same process as previously stated for issues. If none of the official developers are focused on more important issues or deem the idea not worth working on, we will still leave the idea there and anyone who finds it interesting can work on it.
